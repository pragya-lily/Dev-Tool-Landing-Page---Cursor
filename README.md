## Fonts Used

The website uses the system font stack:

```
system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, sans-serif
```

This ensures fast loading, clean readability, and a native feel across operating systems.

- Background: `#000000`  
- Card background: `#0a0a0a`  
- Borders: `#222222`  
- Primary text: `#ffffff`

These colors were chosen to replicate the dark, developer-focused aesthetic commonly used in modern AI tools.
